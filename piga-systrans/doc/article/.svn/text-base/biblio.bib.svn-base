	abstract = {{SIP}-based networks are becoming the de-facto standard for voice, video and instant messaging services. {B}eing exposed to many threats while playing an major role in the operation of essential services, the need for dedicated security management approaches is rapidly increasing. {I}n this paper we present an original security management approach based on a specific vulnerability aware {SIP} stateful firewall. {T}hrough known attack descriptions, we illustrate the power of the configuration language of the firewall which uses the capability to specify stateful objects that track data from multiple {SIP} elements within their lifetime. {W}e demonstrate through measurements on a real implementation of the firewall its efficiency and performance.},
